# Lab 2: HTML5 Web Page & Validation

## Objective
In this lab, I created a structured HTML5 webpage using semantic elements, added a form with validation, and published the project on GitHub.


## Steps
1. **Project Setup**: I created a folder named `lab2-html` and added `index.html` and `README.md`.

2. **Building the Web Page**: I structured the page using semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.

3. **Adding a Contact Form**: I implemented a form with fields for Name, Email, and Message, ensuring proper validation.

4. **HTML Validation**: I used the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for errors and fixed any issues found.

5. **Publishing to GitHub**: I initialized a Git repository, committed my files, and pushed the project to GitHub.
